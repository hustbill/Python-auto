<p>Some wrong with my Chinese input. So I have no choice to write
my log in english. It is a challenge to me.&nbsp;<wbr></P>
<p>Monday, I’m homesick, very tied. so have no process for my
training.</P>
<p>Tuesday, I also get up earily. So, on the afternoon, I’m eager
to sleep.</P>
<p>Wenesday, everthing runs well as normally. Shawn, Ray and I go
to the bookstore to search and read books.</P>
<p>Thursday, the food is delicious .</P>
<p>&nbsp;<wbr></P>
<p>That’s all.</P>
<p>Just like child’s words. &#58;-)</P>
