<p>Virginia Woolf is remembered as both a feminist and a modernist
whose novels often ignored traditional plots to follow the inner
lives and musings of her characters.</P>
<p>Achievement as Novelist</P>
<p>Two of Virginia Woolf's novels in particular, <i>Mrs.
Dalloway</I> (1925) and <i>To the Lighthouse</I> (1927), follow
successfully the latter approach. The first novels covers a day in
the life of Mrs. Dalloway in postwar London; it achieves its vision
of reality through the reception by Mrs. Dalloway's mind of what
Virginia Woolf called those '<a HREF="http&#58;//www.answers.com/topic/myriad">myriad</A>
impressions - trivial, fantastic, <a HREF="http&#58;//www.answers.com/topic/evanescent">evanescent</A>,
or engraved with the sharpness of steel." <i>To the
Lighthouseis,</I> in a sense, a family portrait and history
rendered in subjective depth through selected points in time. Part
I deals with the time between six o'clock in the evening and
dinner. Primarily through the consciousness of Mrs. Ramsay, it
presents the clash of the male and female sensibilities in the
family; Mrs. Ramsay functions as a means of <a HREF="http&#58;//www.answers.com/topic/equipoise">equipoise</A>
and reconciliation. Part II&#58; Time Passes, is a

to the house. Part III moves toward completion of this <a HREF="http&#58;//www.answers.com/topic/intricate">intricate</A>
and subjective portrait through the adding of a last detail to a
painting by an artist guest, Lily Briscoe, and through the final
completion of a plan, rejected by the father in Part I, for him and
the children to sail out to the lighthouse. The novel is
impressionistic, subjectively perceptive, and <a HREF="http&#58;//www.answers.com/topic/poignant">poignant</A>.</P>
