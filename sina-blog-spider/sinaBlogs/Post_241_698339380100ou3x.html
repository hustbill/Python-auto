<p>A simple test for deciding whether to keep information is to ask
yourself these questions&#58;</P>
<ul>
<li>Does the information relate to one of your meaningful
objectives? <b>If not, delete it</B>.</LI>
<li>Can you find the information somewhere else, such as another
department, a SharePoint site, your company intranet, or the
Internet? <b>If so, delete it</B>.</LI>
<li>Are you likely to refer to the information in the next six
months? <b>If not, delete it</B>.</LI>
<li>Do you have to keep the information because it is legal or
human resources information? <b>If not, delete it</B>.</LI>
</UL>
