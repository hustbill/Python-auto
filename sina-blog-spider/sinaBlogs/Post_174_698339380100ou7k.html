everything that is learned is contained in books.” Compare and
contrast knowledge gained form experience with knowledge gained
form books. In your opinion, which source is more important?

In general,</SPAN></I> <span LANG="EN-US" XML:LANG="EN-US">knowledge gained form books has a wider range than that
gained from experience. We now live in a world that typophile is no
longer exorbitant, and that printed matters are readily available.
In libraries, we can learn nearly everything only if we have
already acquired basic reading skills, philosophy, history,
literature, physics, mathematics, chemicals, biology, geography,
anthropology, and the list will go on. Unlike the experience of an
individual that is limited by the range of that individual, books
seem to have almost no limitation. Sitting in the local library, we
virtually can travel everywhere through an interesting geographic
encyclopedia, and certainly, with nearly no expense at
all.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

other hand</I>, it can be argued that sometimes knowledge gained
from experience is much deeper and more comprehensive than that
gained from books. It is quite true that not every thing is
contained in books. How to deal with personal finance, how to cope
with current social trends, even how to most effectively organize
our own mind, and numerous other things can seldom be found
thoroughtly and comprehensively discussed in books, we have to gain
the knowledge by our own experience. And the said even some
knowledge that is contained in books usually needs further
comprehension, mainly through
experience.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<p STYLE=""><span LANG="EN-US" XML:LANG="EN-US"><font SIZE="3"><font COLOR="#000000"><font FACE="Times New Roman"><span STYLE="">&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr></SPAN> As to which source
is more important, the answers vary. Some knowledge can be acquired
only through books. It’s hard to imagine we can have a good
understanding of history without reading books. On the other hand,
some knowledge can be obtained only through experience. When we try
to learn to swim, merely a detailed manual of swimming skills, even
abundantly filled with illustrations, is at most useless. We have
to jump into the water and then gain the knowledge with experience.
We have to use books to experience as source simultaneously to get
what we want to know. Take learning physics for example, both books
and experiences are equally important sources, and examples as such
are numerous. Therefore, I think whether one source is more
important than the other depends on
circumstances.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
